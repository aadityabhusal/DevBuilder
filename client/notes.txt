ISSUES

1. (Done) React Iframe Component doesn't get removed form its parent after being dragged into another element even though it gets removed from the DOM
   Currently Searching: "unmount component in react hooks" and "remove a component from react virtual dom"
2. (Done) Dragging an Iframe Component and dropping in the same parent div makes the Iframe Component disappear
3. (Done) Create an add below and above add above option on either hover or right click
4. While Adding/Updating elements in the iframe do the following things:
   a. (Done) Update the DOM
   b. (Done) Update the element in the site JSON tree
5. (Done) Return dragged element to its original position if not dropped in another element 
6. (Done) Error when dropping image element
7. (Done) Give more unique ids to elements and layout childrens
8. (Done) Implementing Undo and Redo functionalities (which will solve problem 5) 
9. (Done) Slide/Shift and Reorder sibling item while dragover -- Or provide options on right click to move items or send to top/bottom
10. (Done) Elements reappearing inside previous parent after being dragged and dropped into a new parent
11. (Done) Dropping adds drop command twice
12. (Done) Work on element position, and sorting when dragover
13. (Done) When creating _ids for elements place them in the children_order property
14. (Done) The whole procedure for inserting and removing elements should be change. Watch the video from WebDevSimlified Drag-Drop-Sorting
15. (Now) Validating DOM Nesting i.e. not allowing list item to be nestes inside another list item
16. (Later) Create separate element attributes for html attributes such as required, controls etc. They can be stored in a array with a checkbox for each of them in the properties panel that can push and pop them in and out of the array respectively.
17. Stopping Unnecessary renders of the elements
18. All the elements render when selecting an element and making changes to SelectedElementContext
19. Find a way to access an IframeElement element and then modify it without rendering every element in the site


HTML boolean attributes such as 'required', 'controls' can be stored in an array that could be stored as a value of a property in the element object.
E.g. {
   tagName: "",
   ...,
   booleanAttributes: ['required', '...']
}

The Properties Panel will contain the list of all the boolean (and all other) attributes of each element. The program will then check the attributes present in the boolean attributes. The user can add/remove boolean attributes by checking/unchecking in Properties panel

Implementation
1. Realtime db upadate
2. In-browser update and caching
3. Global function for adding, removing and moving elements
