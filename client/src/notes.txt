ISSUES

1. React Iframe Component doesn't get removed form its parent after being dragged into another element even though it gets removed from the DOM
   Currently Searching: "unmount component in react hooks" and "remove a component from react virtual dom"
2. (Done) Dragging an Iframe Component and dropping in the same parent div makes the Iframe Component disappear
3. Create an add below and above add above option on either hover or right click
4. While Adding/Updating elements in the iframe do the following things:
   a. (Done) Update the DOM
   b. Update the element in the site JSON tree
   c. Update the navigator tree
5. Return dragged element to its original position if not dropped in another element 
6. Validating DOM Nesting i.e. not allowing list item to be nestes inside another list item
7. Error when dropping image element
8. Stopping Unnecessary renders of the elements
9. Implementing Undo and Redo functionalities
10. Slide/Shift and Reorder sibling item while dragover -- Or provide options on right click to move items or send to top/bottom
11. 



DIFFERENT APPROACH
Every Drag and drop does only one action i.e. Solely manipuates the dom using dom events on e.target (no React)

When the user hits the save button a function parses the Tree and extracts the json and sends to the server
